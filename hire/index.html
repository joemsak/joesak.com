                Yes, though I am already contracted full-time with a client,

                  Web development is specialized labor which involves
                  a variety of tasks to achieve the end goals. Any one
                  component of the project will require planning,
                  meeting, writing, coding, testing, QAing, demoing,
                  training, sketching, thinking during 'off' hours,
                  system administration, deployment, and more.
                  It's not only difficult to quantify these different
                  tasks for line items, I find tracking hours to be
                  just plain tedious. If you're not comfortable with
                  that, we're probably not a good fit.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Because of this, I prefer to invoice a flat rate for
                  a guaranteed range of time that I will focus on our
                  project. If you're reasonably unhappy with the
                  results, I will put in a reasonable amount of extra
                  work to make it right for you.
                </p>
              </dd>

              <dt class="hire-questions__question">
                Do you offer a non-profit discount?
              </dt>

              <dd class="hire-questions__answer">
                <p>
                  Yes, I offer a 50% discount to any non-profit
                  organization which has a mission that I can ethically
                  support. Submit your proof of 503c status and I will
                  work for you on the discount.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, the caveat is that I will only commit to one
                  non-consecutive month of NPO discounted work at a
                  time, so I may not be available.
