        <p>
          Are you tired of your Google Drive junk drawer? Is your team resorting to
          sprawling spreadsheets and disorganized docs? It's time for something
          better.

        <h1>I organize disparate systems.</h1>

        <p>
          Until now, you've patched together whatever tools you could find. You've
          got logins to multiple services, and email from all over the place. When
          you were small enough this was fine. But now you're growing, and you
          need smarter, integrated systems that will grow with you.

      <section class="selling-point">
        <h1>Let's automate the tedium.</h1>

        <p>
          Your team spends all their time and energy fitting spreadsheets and docs
          into your mold. We both know that you all have greater talents than figuring
          out how to fuss with such blunt tools. Get back to the real work you're
          actually trying to do while your application puts things right where you
          need them.
